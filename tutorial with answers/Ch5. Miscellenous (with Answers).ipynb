Also, I learned how to retrieve uploaded files from colab folders. For example, to retrieve these files you must import os and then DATA_DIR = '/(name of folder)'. Using the debugging tool, pdb, I learned how to detect problems within coding and how to fix them. List comprehension can be used for reinterations to extract data from filters and to also shorten code for functions involving lists. Finally, I also learned how to use quick pythonic functions such as join(), min(), max(), etc. in order to write ande execute coding quickly. For future programming, I especially hope to memorize how to open files and debugging since I feel these are very essential tools that will be used often."]}]}
